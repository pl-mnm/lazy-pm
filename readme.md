# Lazy afternoon

A simple boilerplate I use to quickly get started on static sites using Roots and PostCSS

## Setup

- make sure [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [roots](http://roots.cx) are installed
- clone this repo down and `cd` into the folder
- run `npm install`
- run `roots watch`
- stop being lazy
